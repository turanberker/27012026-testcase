<I>Megadeal Coupon Limit Requirement</I>
<p>
The requirement stating that "New coupons can be requested at most 5 times, 
at the same time" has not been fully understood. It is interpreted to mean that a maximum of 5 Megadeal-type coupons can be active (ready for use) concurrently. In other words, at any given moment, the system should not allow more than 5 Megadeal coupons to exist in an active state. This ensures controlled distribution and prevents over-allocation of these special coupons.
